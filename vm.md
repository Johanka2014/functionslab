You will need a Docker environment to complete this lab.  A Virtual box vm can be used as an option:

## 1. Install VirtualBox if needed:

* [Get and Install VirtualBox for your Laptop](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/overview/index.html)

## 2. Download and import an example VM:

* [Download Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b_1Mdmwol8gjkcx4B_VmSLSPDOiBKYr1)

## 3. Note these configuration changes:

* When importing the ova, set CPU and Memory appropriately for your laptop.  Typically, use half of your actual CPU and Memory.
* Once you have imported the VM, you can remove or reconfigure the shared folder (Settings > Shared Folders)
When the VM is running:
* Set Keyboard to US English (set "en1" to "en2" on Top Nav, to the left of the Date and Time)
* Set Proxy Settings in Firefox to "No Proxy" (Preferences > Advanced > Network > Connection > Settings)
* Sudo -s password is "demo"
