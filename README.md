# functionslab

In this lab, you will explore basic Docker commands to run a Docker container and build an image, then push it to a registry.  You will also explore (enter functions overview)

This document is meant to be an overview of the entire lab.  Throughout, you may be directed to other labs, to run specific sections.  It is important that when you finish each major section, you return to this document for the next section.

## Section 0 - Have a Docker Environment

* [Docker Options](vm.md)

## Section 1 - Verify Docker Engine Hands on Lab Environment

In this first section you are going to verify that you are able to access to your Docker Engine environment. For convenience, run as root, so that you do not have to preface everything with sudo.  In a terminal: 

```
$ sudo -s
```

Now, here is the Docker specific command to check what version is installed:

```
$ docker --version
```

If Docker is installed and running, you should see an output of something like this:

```
Docker version 17.0x.x-ce, build 276fd32
```

## Section 2 - Complete these 3 Docker exercises

* [Hello Helloworld](https://github.com/oracle/cloud-native-devops-workshop/blob/master/containers/docker001/Participant-Guide.md#hello-helloworld)

* [Create a Dockerfile and Docker image](https://github.com/oracle/cloud-native-devops-workshop/blob/master/containers/docker001/Participant-Guide.md#create-a-dockerfile-and-docker-image)

* [Push an Image to your Docker Hub Account](https://github.com/oracle/cloud-native-devops-workshop/blob/master/containers/docker001/Participant-Guide.md#create-a-dockerfile-and-docker-image)

> *Note - Be sure to return to this lab, after completing the above.
